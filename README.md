  Relived CV template powered by Typst
  
</p>



## What is this for?

**AwesomeCV-Typst** is a [**Typst**](https://github.com/typst/typst) template for making **RÃ©sume** , **CV** or **Cover Letter** inspired by the famous LaTeX CV template [**Awesome-CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). 

## Current Issues

> As Typst is still a very young (although very promising and robust to my belief) project, some features are only partially supported on certain platforms. It is hence difficult to predict any anomalies, but you are definitely welcomed to bring a PR, an issue or a discussion!

- **Font variants**: on local dev environment, some font variants used in this project (notably *Roboto* in my case) cannot be captured and processed by Typst.
- **Image cropping**: Typst does not have direct support to crop images using native primitives. Bring your own cropped image for profile photo if needed.

## Roadmap

> I will gradually develop the template and bring all features that I made possible on the LaTeX platform. These features include:

- **Better Header**: the header should be smarter, with possibilities to customize contact info section, as well as adjust profile image position and shape, etc.
- **Multilingual support**: manage your CV **content** in different language versions (three languages, in my case) in a single project, while without touching on the format. 
- **Cover Letter**: write your cover letter using the same aesthetic design.


## Credit

- [**Typst**](https://github.com/typst/typst) is a new-born, open source and simple typesetting engine that offers a better scripting experience than [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/).
- [**Awesome-CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is the original LaTeX CV template from which this project is heavily inspired. Thanks [posquit0](https://github.com/posquit0) for your excellent work!
